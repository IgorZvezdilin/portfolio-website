# Portfolio

I create a website about my expirience in web programming.
This website contain information about me, my skills and my projects. Also it contains form to contact with me. When you full the form and click submit you data send nothing. If you want to contact me, write me on github or mail.


## Technologies

### CSS
I use css flexbox layout and try to create adaptive size
using media quaries. 
I also try to use responsive width and height and try to 
systematize css properties.

### JS

I use js to add some interactivites:
- Change name to login and back in main page,
- Canvas to drow mouse in main page;
- Button which hide/show canvas;
- Button which explain how you can drow in canvas;
- Hover effect on projects
- Validation the form

When you come at the main page of my Portfolio, canvas auto on and you auto start drowing. If you want to drow something, click at the appropriate button.

You may notice that validation does not work, but this is not quiet true. The things is that the form does not send anywhere, so i decide to use JS to interact with button submit to show a message.
